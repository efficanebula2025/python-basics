# Teaching the robot to remember its name
robot_name = "Buddy"
print("My name is", robot_name)


# How this works:
# robot_name is like a box with a label
# = means "put this information in the box"
# "Buddy" is the information we're storing
# Later, when we say robot_name, the robot looks in that box and finds "Buddy"
